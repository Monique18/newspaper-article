            <p>The GirlCode 3-Month Bootcamp, proudly sponsored by Cell C, is a transformative initiative aimed at empowering young South African women with in-demand coding skills and workplace readiness. This intensive online program focuses on Python development and offers daily live instruction, one-on-one mentorship, and hands-on project work in a simulated tech environment. Open to unemployed women aged 18-35 with a qualification in IT or STEM, the bootcamp not only bridges the digital divide but also nurtures the next generation of female tech leaders. Through this partnership, GirlCode and Cell C are driving inclusive innovation and creating real pathways to employment in South Africa's growing digital economy</p>

            <h3>The Perks of being a girlcoder</h3>
            <p>Being a GirlCoder is not just about learning to code-it is about discovering your voice and your place in tech. From the very first day, I felt like a part of a powerful community of women who are passionate, determined, and ready to build something meaningful.Some of the great things is being assigned your very own personal mentor, daily live classes, and full online learning platform access that ensures you never feel stuck or left behind. And it doesn't stop at Python-we dive into <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even React</strong>, building real-world projects that make us tech-career ready. We attend work readiness workshops that sharpen our professional edge and receive certification vouchers to world recognised certificates. Whether I am debugging code late at night or celebrating wins with my bootcamp sisters, I feel seen, supported, and inspired. GirlCode is more than a program-it's a launchpad into a better future in tech.</p>
    
            <h3>The chalenges I have faced so far</h3>
            <p>The program's fast-paced, three-month structure with daily live classes and project work can be intense, requiring strong time management and self-discipline. Balancing technical learning with work readiness sessions and mentorship can feel overwhelming at times, particularly when juggling personal responsibilities as well. Also the remote format demands reliable internet access and a quiet space to focus, which isn't always easy to secure, lack of enough Funding and shortage of facilitators slows down our progress. Aditionally feeling like an imposter when I am falling behind or not getting the concepts as fast as the others  </p>

            <h3>Things I hope to achieve after the bootcamp</h3>
            <p>I hope to walk away from the bootcamp with hands on experience in python fundamentals including data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and working with APIs enough to build real-world applications. I expect to have a good looking portfolio with projects under my belt which I can showcase to potential employers or on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn. To advance my soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, plus gain confidence in navigating interviews and professional environments. Most importantly boosted confidence with a clearer career direction, industry insights, and a stronger sense of belonging in tech.</p>
